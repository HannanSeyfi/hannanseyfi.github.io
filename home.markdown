Hi, I'm **Hannan Seyfi**. I'm currently a Master's candidate in Artificial Intelligence at Khatam University (Tehran, Iran). My research focuses on **unlearning in large language models**.

I have served as a teaching assistant for C++ programming and taught Artificial Intelligence & Data Science, Advanced Python Programming, Logic Circuits, and Microcontrollers Programming at NODET high schools.

I also bring experience in game development, design, and backend development. My interests include trustworthy and efficient AI, model editing and unlearning, and practical machine learning systems.
